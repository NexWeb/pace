# Pace API definition

Pace uses the [Oto project](https://github.com/pacedotdev/oto) to describe its API using Go (Golang) interfaces.

The definition can be found in the `definition` folder.

The Oto tooling combines the definition with the templates to generate simple API clients like the Go client library, and the Pace CLI tool.
